Changes
=======

Version 0.7.3 (released 2023-10-26)
-----------------------------------

- menu: skip error when same and equal menu value exists

Version 0.7.2 (released 2020-05-07)
-----------------------------------

- Deprecated Python versions lower than 3.6.0. Now supporting 3.6.0 and 3.7.0.

Version 0.7.1 (released 2019-02-11)
-----------------------------------

- Fixes problem with returning an active menu item.

Version 0.7.0 (released 2017-12-12)
-----------------------------------

-  Uses whole segment of the URL instead of a prefix to determine active menu
   item. Currently the menu item is marked as active when there is a prefix
   match on the URL. This creates situations where multiple different menu
   items appear to be active just because they share a prefix. (#62)

Version 0.6.0 (released 2017-08-03)
-----------------------------------

- Fixes Python 3 deprecation warnings.
- Adds the `external_url` parameter to MenuEntryMixin's `register`
  function, allowing menu items with external urls not tied to
  an endpoint.

-----------------------------------

- Improves tests for checking when an item is active.

- Adds new property to MenuEntryMixin which allows the user to retrieve the
  current active item from the MenuEntryMixin's tree. (#43)
- Modifies project structure to be in line with other newer Invenio project
  packages. This includes renaming files to match with files in other projects,
  revising structures of certain files and adding more tools for testing. (#42)

  consider_setuptools_entrypoints(). (#41)

- Flask-Classy support and automatic detection of parameters for
  `url_for`.  (#33)
- Improves how the default active state of items is determined.  (#32)
